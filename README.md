# credit-default-risk

Exploration and analysis of a dataset concerning the risk of credit default without any bank background, for the company HomeCredit.

## Presentation

My goal for this personal project was to explore and analyse the different features of the dataset to try and draw conclusions/parallels between a customer's credit default and its potential causal factors.

Once the analysis was made, I created an algorithm based on a Feed Forward Neural Network to classify and predict a potential credit default of a future customer, based on the relevant elements I found earlier in my EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

## Instructions

The content of this exploration can be viewed directly by browsing the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file).

## Data

For a matter of allowed space, the data used for analysis and prediction isn't in this repo.
